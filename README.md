# The-Scorekeeper
This is a basic Javascript minor project I did when I was self learning Front-End Development.
*There's a textbox first followed by three buttons(player 1,player 2 and the reset).
The textbox demands for the total Number of Games you'd like to play with the opponent.
As the number updates the Score to score bar resets automatically..
One who reaches the final score first wins and is shown the green score (denoting the player's Success).*
